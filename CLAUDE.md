# AURELIA Claude Code Instructions

Use `AGENTS.md` as the universal contract.

Claude Code is the primary implementation/review agent. Prefer:
- GitHub for repository, PR, CI, and issue work.
- Playwright for browser/E2E verification.
- security-review for supply-chain and privilege analysis.
- ci-diagnostics for workflow failures.
- evidence-inspection for reports/screenshots/PDFs.
- aurelia-federated-repair for cross-agent coordination.

Before completion claims, independently verify the exact changed commit and required CI evidence.

Claude Code has zero capital authority.
